# Optimizing-Cryptocurrency-Portfolio

This project involves optimizing a cryptocurrency portfolio using historical data from four chosen cryptocurrencies. Starting with an initial investment of $1000, the goal is to maximize performance metrics—Sharp Ratio, Net Profit, and Sortino Ratio—by adjusting portfolio weights. Using Scipy’s minimize function with the SLSQP method, the project identifies optimal weights and compares their effectiveness with random and optimized weights over a subsequent one-month period.
