# Generation-and-Analysis-of-Stationary-Time-Series-from-Cryptocurrency-Prices

This project involves creating 10 new stationary time series from the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, using a combination of price series. The steps include:

Data Collection: Collected 4-hour timeframe price data for the top 100 cryptocurrencies from January 1, 2022, to November 1, 2023.

Stationarity Testing: Applied Dickey-Fuller and Johansen tests to combinations of 2, 3, or up to 4 cryptocurrencies to ensure over 95% stationarity.

Reporting:

Cryptocurrency Details: Reported the names, weights, and p-values of the selected cryptocurrencies.
Hurst Exponent: Calculated the Hurst Exponent for each new time series.
Half-Life Calculation: Computed the half-life for the resulting time series.
